# Anime Gallery by Yagasaki7K

This is a gallery of animated anime images, involving only HTML and CSS. The code was also adapted for next, where we have a more direct version of the code.

It is recommended to use in production, if you are going to use the following code, in addition to placing the appropriate copyrights, the version in the `nextjs` folder, since it has a more direct and fluid adaptation of the animation. The same style is represented in the demo website.

The [9da020e](https://github.com/Yagasaki7K/website-animegallery/commit/9da020e598956ae1b364f45df85960f1b1950c40) update concerns the dark theme available in CSS3. This is based on the user's browser system configuration. If the user chooses to choose the light theme in their browser, they will be seeing the light theme, which consists of a white background. If they choose the dark theme in their browser, they will be seeing the dark theme, which consists of a dark background.
